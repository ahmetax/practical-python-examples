# Flask + SQLite REST API — Test Guide

This document is for testing the API initialized with `flask_sqlite_api.py`
Contains `curl` commands that can be used.

## Initialization

```bash
python 02_flask_sqlite_api.py
```

Server starts running at `http://localhost:8117`.
If the `library.db` file does not exist, it will be created automatically and filled with sample data.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rating": 4.7}'

#6. Confirm the update
curl http://localhost:8117/api/books/11

# 7. Delete book

## Notes

- The `library.db` file is preserved when the server is stopped and restarted.
Data is not duplicated thanks to `INSERT OR IGNORE`.
- To reset the database, delete the `library.db` file.
- Instead of `curl`, you can also use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or
[HTTPie](https://httpie.io/).
