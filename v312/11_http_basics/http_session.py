Description:
    Managing HTTP sessions using Python's requests.Session object.

    By default, each requests.get() or requests.post() call opens a new
    TCP connection to the server and closes it when done. This is fine
    for occasional requests, but inefficient when making many requests
    to the same host.

    A Session object reuses the same TCP connection (HTTP keep-alive),
    which means:
      - Faster requests — no repeated TCP handshake overhead
      - Shared headers and auth — set once, applied to every request
      - Cookie persistence — cookies returned by the server are
        automatically sent back on subsequent requests

    Three patterns are demonstrated:
      1. Basic session usage   — reusing a connection for multiple requests
      2. Session-level headers — set Authorization or User-Agent once
      3. Session with cookies  — automatic cookie handling across requests

    For testing we use https://httpbin.org which echoes back headers,
    cookies, and auth details so we can verify session state clearly.

Requirements:
    pip install requests
