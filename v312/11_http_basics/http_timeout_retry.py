Description:
    Handling timeouts and automatic retries for HTTP requests.
    Network requests can fail for many reasons: slow servers, dropped
    connections, temporary outages. This example shows how to write
    robust request code that recovers gracefully from such failures.

    Three patterns are demonstrated:
      1. Timeout control      — don't wait forever for a response
      2. Manual retry loop    — retry failed requests with a delay
      3. Retry with backoff   — increase wait time between each retry
                                to avoid hammering a struggling server

    For testing, we use https://httpbin.org which provides endpoints
    that simulate delays and errors on demand:
      /delay/{n}         — waits n seconds before responding
      /status/{code}     — returns the given HTTP status code

Requirements:
    pip install requests

    If you pass a single value, it applies to both.
